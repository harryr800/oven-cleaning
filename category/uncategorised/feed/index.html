<p class="font_7">Most off-the-shelf oven cleaning products are the most toxic and corrosive oven cleaning products you can use.  Many contain Caustic Soda which can not only damage your oven but also the health of your family. If these products are not used correctly the damage they can cause is irreversible. I have seen many ovens where the product has been applied incorrectly and/or not completely removed. It is when these products are not completely removed that they continue to &#8216;eat away&#8217; at the oven parts eventually leading to corrosion. The effects of this are rusty racks and chipped or flaking enamel. Self Cleaning liners will absorb the cleaning product and lose their functionality and appear stained as in the photo above.  I&#8217;ve also seen heating elements so badly corroded that they needed to be replaced, chrome racks completely rusted, enamel interiors with chipped and rusty spots and white streak stains on and in between the glass door.  Beware of using caustic products on the oven door. They can dissolve the glue holding the glass onto the door with disastrous results. In my opinion the lifespan of these ovens have been reduced due to the corrosive damage. I often point out the corrosion and residue stains before I start cleaning and ask the client what they have used in the past. Most of the time it is usually these types of oven cleaning products they have used incorrectly.</p>
<p class="font_7">A lot of these products are sold as &#8216;non-caustic&#8217; as the ph value of caustic is around 14 and they test below this value. The product may be technically &#8216;non-caustic&#8217; but still have a relatively high ph and high alkaline bordering on being caustic. If the product you are using requires that it &#8216;sit&#8217; or &#8216;react&#8217; with the dirt for a length of time then more than likely it is high alkaline or caustic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s so clean I don&#8217;t want to use it&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>As Professional Oven Cleaners we hear these words all the time. You are amazed at how clean your good-as-new oven looks after our technician has done his magic that you almost don&#8217;t want to use it in case you dirty it again!</p>
<p>Inevitably the time will come for a Professional Clean again but in the interim Prevention is the Key. Here are our 7  Top Tips with this in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the correct size dish. </strong>If your dish has the potential to boil over be careful not to overfill. Also consider placing the dish on another baking tray to catch any spillages.</li>
<li><strong>Use the BBQ. </strong>If cooking meat with high fat content consider using the BBQ. Many BBQ&#8217;s now have roasting hoods and utilise &#8216;blue flame&#8217; which enhance flavour.</li>
<li><strong>Use a Roasting Bag</strong>. A roasting bag will not only retain the moisture content of your roast but it will eliminate the splatter of grease and fat throughout your oven. This excess grease and fat throughout your oven may taint any subsequent cooking if not removed correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Use a lid where appropriate.</strong> Using a lid to cover food whilst is being cooked will eliminate the spatter of grease and fat onto the oven surfaces. Using lidded casserole dishes or covered glass bakeware is ideal for this.</li>
<li><strong>Wipe up any mess ASAP.</strong> The longer any spillages or mess stay in your oven the harder it will be to remove so as soon as it is safe to do so wipe away the mess with warm soapy water.</li>
<li><strong>Place a tray on the bottom rack of the Oven.</strong> The tray can be easily removed and cleaned immediately after cooking. Be careful not to place the tray on the floor of the oven as some ovens operate with an element under the floor of the oven and may crack and scorch the enamel. I would also not recommend using foil on the tray as the foil can come loose and short out elements and mark the enamel.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure your thermostat is working accurately.</strong> It is common to be unaware that your oven thermostat is not accurate. Mostly the Oven is getting hotter than the dial indicates and the increased oven temperature sends grease and fat in all directions inside your oven. An easy way to check is to buy a separate oven thermometer  from a kitchen and homewares shop.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually the time will come where only a lot of elbow grease and TLC will suffice and it&#8217;s time to<a href="http://ovencleaning.com.au/contact"> call the experts </a>again.</p>
