Therefore, we\u2019ve put together 6 oven cleaning tips that will keep your oven sparking clean all year round in between professional oven cleans, saving you both money and time in the long-run!<\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wipe up spills immediately<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This only takes a few seconds to do. When you spill or splatter some food in the oven, simply wipe them up immediately with some detergent, water and a cloth. If food spills are not wiped up, they will go hard and burn when the oven is heated, making them much tougher to remove and creating a nasty smell within your oven.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use an oven liner<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can keep the oven floor clean by using an oven liner. These are matts designed to catch any food or drips, which can then be easily removed or cleaned. We do not recommend using foil in your oven as it can etch the surfaces or get sucked into the fan element and cause a fire and\/or damage the element.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use a roasting bag<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another tip for keeping the oven clean is to use roasting bags for meat, fish or even vegies. It is an excellent way to minimise spills whilst baking. Not only will a roasting bag keep your oven clean, it will also enrich the taste of your food by locking in the flavours and natural food moisture.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Give a quick clean regularly<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As soon as you\u2019ve finished using the oven, put a heat-resistant bowl of water inside and heat at a high temperature for 20 minutes. This will help loosen dirt and grease. Then when it\u2019s cool enough, wipe the interior surfaces with paper towels. This creates easy oven cleaning, and means there won\u2019t be as much work which needs to be done when it comes to need a proper clean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>5. Turn on the elements you don\u2019t cook with after cooking<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After removing your cooked food and while the oven is still hot turn on the elements in your oven that you did not use to cook with for a few minutes each on a high temperature. This will burn off grease and fat from those elements and the surfaces close to those elements leaving your oven a lot cleaner for it\u2019s next use. Remember to turn it off again!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Get regular professional oven cleans every 6-12 months<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We recommend using a professional oven cleaning service every 6-12 months, depending on your oven usage. If your oven has a regular deep cleaning using a professional oven cleaning service, you won\u2019t need to do as much to stay on top of it all year round.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If your oven is looking a little worse for wear and it\u2019s in need of a deep clean, you can request a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/ovencleaning.com.au\/contact-us\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>free estimate<\/b><\/span><\/a>\u00a0for your professional oven clean online or by calling\u00a0<strong>07729 845761<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ask Anybody and they\u2019ll tell you that cleaning the oven is the most hated household chore, and certainly it\u2019s a task that many of us put off for as long as possible.
